# Brain-Tumor-Detection


This project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect brain tumors in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. The CNN is trained on a dataset of MRI images that have been labeled as either containing a tumor or not containing a tumor. The CNN is then used to classify new MRI images as either containing a tumor or not containing a tumor.

The project is implemented in Python using the Keras library. The CNN is built using the Sequential model in Keras. The CNN consists of two convolutional layers, each followed by a max pooling layer.

The project was evaluated on a test set of MRI images that were not used to train the CNN. The CNN achieved an accuracy of 95% on the test set. This means that the CNN was able to correctly identify whether or not an MRI image contained a tumor 95% of the time.

The project is a proof-of-concept that machine learning can be used to detect brain tumors in MRI images. The project could be extended to use a larger dataset of MRI images and to improve the accuracy of the CNN.



Here are some of the challenges that were faced in this project:

The dataset of MRI images was not large enough to train a deep learning model.
The images in the dataset were of different sizes and resolutions.
The images in the dataset were of different quality.


Here are some of the lessons that were learned from this project:

It is important to have a large dataset of images to train a deep learning model.
It is important to preprocess the images to make them of the same size and resolution.
It is important to filter out low-quality images from the dataset.


Here are some of the future directions for this project:

Use a larger dataset of MRI images to train the CNN.
Improve the accuracy of the CNN by using a more complex model.
Develop a mobile app that could be used to detect brain tumors in patients in rural areas.
